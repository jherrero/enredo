 DESCRIPTION
=======================================

This program reads an input file containing the results of mapping a set of
anchors onto several genomes. Ideally, each anchor should be found several
times. This program links the anchors according to their positions on the
genomes and try to concatenate the links (edges) when possible. Let be G1 and
G2 two (pieces of) genomes and A, B, C... some anchors.

G1: A---B---C---D---E---F---G
G2: A----B--C-----E-----F---G

The initial graph will have a link from A to B which is found on G1 from 1
to 4 and on G2 from 1 to 5. There will be another link from B to C which
is found on G1 from 4 to 8 and on G2 from 5 to 8. Here is the full list of
links for the previous example:

A-B: G1(1-4); G2(1-5)
B-C: G1(4-8); G2(5-8)
C-D: G1(8-12)
C-E: G2(8-14)
D-E: G1(12-16)
E-F: G1(16-20); G2(14-20)
F-G: G1(20-24); G2(20-24)

A-B and B-C can be concatenated because A-B is always followed by B-C:

A-B-C: G1(1-8); G2(1-8)
C-D: G1(8-12)
C-E: G2(8-14)
D-E: G1(12-16)
E-F: G1(16-20); G2(14-20)
F-G: G1(20-24); G2(20-24)

The same happens with C-D and D-E:

A-B-C: G1(1-8); G2(1-8)
C-D-E: G1(8-16)
C-E: G2(8-14)
E-F: G1(16-20); G2(14-20)
F-G: G1(20-24); G2(20-24)

And E-F and F-G:

A-B-C: G1(1-8); G2(1-8)
C-D-E: G1(8-16)
C-E: G2(8-14)
E-F-G: G1(16-24); G2(14-24)

Using this simple operation, we can use the resulting links to define syntenic
regions.

=======================================
 OPTIONS
=======================================

* FOR BUILDING THE GRAPH *

--max-gap-length:
If the distance between two anchors is larger than this value, they wont be
linked. A value of 0 disable this option.
Default: 10000


* FOR DEFINNING THE SYNTENIC REGIONS *

After concatenating all the links, you can get the resulting syntenic blocks.

--min-length:
Only blocks which are longer than this limit will be printed out. The length
of the block correspond to the shortest of the sequences in that block.
Default: 100kb

--min-regions:
Only blocks containing at least this number of sequences will be dumped.
Default: 2

--min-anchors:
Only blocks having at least this number of anchors will be dumped. At the
beginning, the blocks have only two anchors and a new anchor is added in
each concatenation. The more anchors, the better supported is the block.
Default: 3

--all: print all the syntenic block (overwrite previous values)
Prints everything, even short blocks with one single region.


* FOR THE RESULTING STATS *

--histogram-size: size for histogram of num. of regions per link (def: 10)


=======================================
 INPUT FILE
=======================================

The input file contains the result of mapping a set of anchors onto several
genomes. Anchors are expected to be sorted by organism, chromosome and
position. Each line should correspond to an anchor and each line contains 6
values separated by tabs. The six values are: the anchor name (a string),
the species name (a string), the chromosome name (a string), the start
position (an integer value), the end position (an integer value), the strand
(either + or -) and the score (a real value). Here is an example:

A1      Spcs1   X       53      85      +       123
B1      Spcs1   X       458     498     +       11
C1      Spcs1   X       3601    3639    +       434

A1      Spcs2   X       53      85      +       17

C1      Spcs2   X       3601    3639    +       13
B1      Spcs2   X       5480    5520    +       881
D1      Spcs2   X       6479    6510    +       16
A       Spcs2   Y       4379    4410    +       51
E       Spcs2   Y       5879    5910    +       17
E       Spcs2   Y       6479    6510    +       13
D       Spcs2   Y       6567    6593    +       41
D       Spcs2   Y       7567    7593    +       14
D       Spcs2   Y       8567    8593    +       18
A       Spcs2   Y       9863    9893    +       19
C       Spcs2   Y       10187   10218   +       31

At the moment, strands and scores are ignored but might be used in a future
version.
